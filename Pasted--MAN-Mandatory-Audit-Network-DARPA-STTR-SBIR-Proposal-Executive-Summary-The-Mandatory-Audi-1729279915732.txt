# MAN (Mandatory Audit Network) - DARPA STTR/SBIR Proposal

## Executive Summary

The Mandatory Audit Network (MAN) is an advanced, AI-driven audit system designed to ensure transparency, detect anomalies, and enhance the efficiency of financial reporting for SOLVY and DECIDEY to official government agencies and international entities. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies such as machine learning, blockchain, and advanced cryptography, MAN provides a robust solution for maintaining the integrity and security of financial reporting while improving banking transaction effectiveness.

## Technical Innovation

1. AI-Powered Audit and Anomaly Detection:
   - Utilizes deep learning models to identify suspicious patterns in financial reports.
   - Continuously learns and adapts to new reporting requirements and potential fraud indicators.

2. Blockchain-Based Audit Trail:
   - Immutable record-keeping of all financial reports using smart contracts.
   - Ensures the integrity and non-repudiation of audit logs and submitted reports.

3. Advanced Cryptographic Techniques:
   - Implements zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving audits.
   - Utilizes homomorphic encryption for secure data analysis and sharing with government agencies.

4. Real-time Monitoring and Alerting:
   - Provides instant notifications for high-risk activities or reporting discrepancies.
   - Offers a comprehensive dashboard for internal auditors and compliance officers.

## Military and Civilian Applications

1. Enhanced Financial Intelligence:
   - Improved reporting to FinCEN for more effective anti-money laundering efforts.
   - Enhanced data sharing with Homeland Security for identifying potential financial threats.

2. Streamlined Tax Reporting:
   - Automated, accurate reporting to the IRS, reducing errors and fraud.
   - Real-time tax liability calculations for more efficient fiscal planning.

3. International Financial Cooperation:
   - Facilitated reporting to BRICS and New Development Bank (NDB) for international transactions.
   - Improved transparency in cross-border financial activities.

4. Federal Reserve Reporting:
   - Enhanced accuracy and timeliness of reports to the Federal Reserve.
   - Improved monetary policy decision-making through more reliable financial data.

## Technical Approach

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
   - Implement secure data ingestion pipelines from SOLVY and DECIDEY.
   - Develop robust feature extraction techniques for various report types.

2. Machine Learning Model Development:
   - Train and optimize anomaly detection models using TensorFlow.
   - Implement ensemble methods for improved accuracy in detecting reporting discrepancies.

3. Blockchain Integration:
   - Develop smart contracts for audit log recording and report verification.
   - Implement efficient off-chain data storage solutions for large financial datasets.

4. System Architecture:
   - Design a scalable, microservices-based architecture.
   - Implement secure API gateways for interaction with government agency systems.

5. User Interface Development:
   - Create intuitive dashboards for internal auditors and compliance officers.
   - Develop secure portals for government agency access to relevant financial data.

## Conclusion

The Mandatory Audit Network (MAN) represents a significant advancement in financial auditing and reporting technology. Its potential applications in both military and civilian sectors, coupled with the focus on veteran involvement and university collaboration, make it an ideal candidate for DARPA's STTR/SBIR program. We are confident that MAN will contribute to enhancing the security, efficiency, and integrity of financial reporting systems for critical government agencies and international financial institutions. Edit: my fault, i did request making MAN proposal DARPA ready, but im not satisfied. i want the MAN, Mandatory Audit Network, to care only about audit of SOLVY and DECIDEY reporting activity to official government agencies like IRS, FinCEN, Homeland Security, Federal Reserve, etc. and entities like BRICS, NDB that would concern DARPA but improving banking transactions activity effectiveness. I want to blueprint the DLT to clients/customers from government agencies, when my app is completed and demonstrates effectiveness, i want assistance from contracted universities to implement, but as a military veteran, i wish to qualify and benefit from this program. there are some elements that are congruent but please edit
